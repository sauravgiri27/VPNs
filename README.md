# VPNs
# 🛠️ Configuring Traditional IPSEC between two LANs and ISP: 
This project demonstrates the setup of a site-to-site IPsec VPN between two geographically separated LANs over an ISP network. The configuration ensures secure encrypted communication between the two sites using IKEv1, ISAKMP, and IPsec tunnel mode. The setup is implemented using Cisco routers in EVE-NG/GNS3, with verification through ping, traceroute, and packet captures.
A short overview of the project, stating what it does and why it's useful.
